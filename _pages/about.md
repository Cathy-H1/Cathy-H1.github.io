Hello, my name is Kaixi Hao, and I am a graduate student at Lingnan University in Hong Kong, pursuing a Master of Science in Computational Technology Plus (MScCT+). My academic journey has been diverse and enriching, reflecting my passion for continuous learning and interdisciplinary knowledge.

I completed my undergraduate studies at Fudan University, where I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in International Economics and Trade. During my time at Fudan, I was consistently recognized for my academic excellence, receiving multiple scholarships. These achievements not only validated my dedication to my studies but also motivated me to explore various fields beyond my primary discipline.

Prior to my undergraduate studies, I attended Shanghai University of Engineering Science, where I obtained an Associate Degree in Mold Design and Manufacturing. This technical background provided me with a solid foundation in engineering principles and practical skills, which I have found invaluable in my subsequent academic and professional pursuits.

My educational path has equipped me with a unique blend of skills and knowledge. My undergraduate degree in International Economics and Trade has given me a deep understanding of global economic dynamics and market trends. Meanwhile, my technical education in mold design and manufacturing has honed my problem-solving abilities and attention to detail. These experiences have prepared me well for my current graduate program, where I am focusing on the intersection of computational technology and business.

Throughout my academic career, I have been actively involved in various extracurricular activities and projects. At Fudan University, I participated in case competitions and research projects, which enhanced my analytical and teamwork skills. Additionally, I have volunteered in community service initiatives, which have instilled in me a strong sense of social responsibility and leadership.

I have a strong desire to pursue a PhD in the future. My goal is to contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the field of computational technology and its applications in economics and business. I am particularly interested in how advanced computational methods can be used to solve complex economic and business problems. I believe that further academic research will not only deepen my understanding but also enable me to make meaningful contributions to the field.

If you share my interests and would like to learn more about my work or collaborate, please feel free to contact me at cathy2568@yeah.net. I am eager to connect with like-minded individuals and explore new opportunities for collaboration and growth.

My work is on the social, cultural, political, and economic aspects of quantification, data science, automation, and AI. I have long focused on the role of AI in the governance and moderation of social media platforms and online communities, but I also care about issues like fairness, privacy, accountability, and labor in many application domains where AI is being deployed. Finally, I take the institutions of scientific and technological research as my object of study, asking how the disciplines and professions are changing around or by quantification, data science, automation, and AI. 

## My interests
I have a strong passion for artificial intelligence and computer vision, areas that captivate me with their potential to revolutionize various industries. My interest in these fields has driven me to develop a solid foundation in Python programming, which I use extensively for both personal projects and professional tasks. I frequently leverage various AI websites and tools to enhance my coding skills and stay updated with the latest advancements in the field.

One of my favorite aspects of AI and computer vision is the ability to create intelligent systems that can perceive and interact with the world in meaningful ways. Whether it's developing algorithms to recognize patterns in images or building models to predict future trends, I find the process both challenging and rewarding. I enjoy experimenting with different machine learning frameworks and libraries, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, to push the boundaries of what is possible.

In addition to my academic and professional interests, I have a vibrant and active lifestyle. I love sports and outdoor activities that keep me physically fit and mentally refreshed. Climbing mountains and cycling are two of my favorite pastimes. These activities not only provide a great way to stay active but also offer a sense of adventure and a chance to connect with nature. The physical and mental challenges of climbing and cycling help me maintain a balanced and healthy lifestyle.

I also have a keen interest in activities that give me a sense of adventure and thrill. One of my passions is motorcycling. Riding a motorcycle is more than just a mode of transportation for me; it's a way to experience the world at a different pace and to feel the wind and the road beneath me. This hobby has not only brought me joy but has also deepened my interest in motorcycle mechanics and engineering.

My love for motorcycles has led me to delve into the intricacies of their design and function. I enjoy tinkering with my bike, making modifications, and improving its performance. This hands-on approach has taught me valuable skills in mechanical engineering and problem-solving. It has also given me a deeper appreciation for the craftsmanship and engineering that goes into building high-performance vehicles.

Overall, my interests span a wide range of activities, from cutting-edge technology to outdoor adventures and hands-on mechanical work. Each of these pursuits contributes to my personal growth and helps me develop a well-rounded skill set. Whether I'm coding a new AI algorithm, climbing a mountain, or modifying my motorcycle, I find immense satisfaction in pushing myself to new heights and exploring new possibilities.
